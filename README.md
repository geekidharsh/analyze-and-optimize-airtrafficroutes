---

#### Project Solution Layout:
	- I used python to decompress raw data, build some cleaning functions using pandas. Next up, i pused the data on MySQL built models for it and ran queries to answer the questions provided.
	- I also gathered some data that wasn't provided, like some lookup datasets for flights and used join to map them to the original dataset in order to better understand the case. 
	- I built a presentation for the entire study drawing inferences from the data and my learnings and better convey the story. Optionally, bult a little webpage using html5 and css and embeded Tableau viz.
